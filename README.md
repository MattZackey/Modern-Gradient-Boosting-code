# Modern-Gradient-Boosting-code

The following gives the section where the code is from:

  * Section 1.2.4 (Boosting) : Boosting regression.ipynb

  * Section 2.2 (Adaptive boosting) : AdaBoost simulation.Rmd

  * Section 2.2 (Adaptive boosting) : AdaBoost Overlap data.ipynb

  * Section 4.4 (Analysis of regularisation in XGBoost) : Analysis of reg in XGBoost.ipynb

  * Section 5.5 (A comparison of row subsampling and GOSS) : Row subsampling and GOSS.ipynb

  * Section 6.2 (Target statistics) : Target statistics simulation.Rmd

  * Section 6.5 (An empirical study of CatBoost) : CatBoost.ipynb

  * Appendix E.1 (Preprocessing of the Customer Satisfaction dataset) : Preprocessing Customer Satisfaction.ipynb


The orginal datasets are: 

 * Phoneme : phoneme.csv

 * Adult : adult1.csv and adult2.csv (These two datasets were combined)

 *  Customer Satisfaction : customersat.zip
